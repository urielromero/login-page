# login-page
This is a simple appication to demonstrate how a databebase can work in your website.



I am using XAMPP to create a local web server. Here, the sign up info the user inputs is saved in local databse. Then this
information is used to log in into your home page. 

If you dont have an account you signup, then you are redirected to the log in page.
After loging in with correct credentials you are sent to you homepage/dashboard. 

In the future I will create an applicaton with an actual web server.
