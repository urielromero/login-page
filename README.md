# login-page
This is a simple appication to demonstrate how a databebase can work in your website.



I am using XAMPP to create a local web server. 


In this application, you can signup to create a todo list account. Where each user is assigned its own table in the database to store their tasks. 

The application is able to verify correct passowords when registering and also for correct credentials when logining in. Each with its respective alert. 
 
When logged in, you can view and add new tasks. 

I will be adding functionality to delete items in the future to comply with CRUD appication guidelines.
